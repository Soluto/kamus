[kind] is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes".  
kind is primarily designed for testing Kubernetes 1.11+, initially targeting the [conformance tests].

If you have [go] and [docker] installed `go get -u sigs.k8s.io/kind && kind create cluster` is all you need!

kind consists of:

- Go [packages][packages] implementing [cluster creation][cluster package], [image build][build package], etc.
- A command line interface ([`kind`][kind cli]) built on these packages.
- Docker [image(s)][images] written to run systemd, Kubernetes, etc.
- [`kubetest`][kubetest] integration also built on these packages (WIP)

kind bootstraps each "node" with [kubeadm][kubeadm]. For more details see [the design documentation][design doc].

**NOTE**: kind is still a work in progress, see the [1.0 roadmap].

## Installation and usage

For more detailed instructions see [the user guide][user guide].

You can install kind with `go get sigs.k8s.io/kind`. This will put `kind` in
`$(go env GOPATH)/bin`. You may need to add that directory to your `$PATH` as
shown [here](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) if you encounter the error
`kind: command not found` after installation.

To use kind, you will also need to [install docker].  
Once you have docker running you can create a cluster with `kind create cluster`  
To delete your cluster use `kind delete cluster`

<!--TODO(bentheelder): improve this part of the guide-->
To create a cluster from Kubernetes source:

- ensure that Kubernetes is cloned in `$(go env GOPATH)/src/k8s.io/kubernetes`
- build a node image and create a cluster with `kind build node-image && kind create cluster --image kindest/node:latest`

Multi-node clusters and other advanced features may be configured with a config
file, for more usage see [the user guide][user guide] or run `kind [command] --help`
