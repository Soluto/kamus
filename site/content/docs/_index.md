# Welcome to kind's Documentation


## Usage

Here you will find all details to get you started along with some more advanced
use cases.

## Contributing
If you are interested in modifying or contributing to kind, you can go and

For those interested in contributing to the project with code or documentation,
the [development guide][dev guide] will give you a more in-depth look into how 
kind works. 
We will start by getting the required software and setting up the environment
and then take a look into how kind and its different packages are laid out.
