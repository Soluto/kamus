Feature: Block anonymous internet access to Kamus
  In order to protect Kamus from DoS
  As an engineer
  I want to block anonymous access to Kamus from the internet


  Scenario: Use Kubernetes port-forward
    Given a user has valid Kubernetes config file
    When the user open port forward to Kamus service
    Then the user can use Kamus for encryption

  Scenario: User authentication
    Given an authenticated user (using Kubernetes user token?)
    When the user try to encrypt a secret
    Then the user is allowed to perform the request
  
  Scenario: IP filtering
    Given an authenticated user (using Kubernetes user token?)
    When the user try to encrypt a secret
    Then the user is allowed to perform the request only from a white-listed IPs
