# Project Structure

ðŸš§ This is a work-in-progress ðŸš§

## CLI
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ kind
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ build/   # Build images
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ create/  # Create cluster
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ delete/  # Delete cluster
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ get/     # List kubeconfigs and clusters
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ kind.go  # Root command
â”œâ”€â”€ main.go          # Entrypoint
```

The CLI is built using [cobra][cobra] and you can see the app's entrypoint, [`main.go`][main.go], at the root level of the repository.
The CLI commands can be found in the directory [cmd][cmd]. Here, you will find
the root command [kind.go][kind.go] where we register other commands to build
images; create, delete, and list clusters; list kubeconfig files for cluster;
and setup logging.

## Packages
```
â”œâ”€â”€ pkg
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ build     # Build and manage images
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ cluster   # Build and manage clusters
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ docker    # Interact with Docker
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ exec      # Execute commands
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ fs        # Interact with the host file system
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ kustomize # Work with embedded kustomize commands
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ log       # Logging
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ util
```
`kind` commands rely on the functionality of the [packages directory][pkg].
Here, you will find everything needed to build container images for `kind`;
create clusters from these images; interact with the Docker engine and file system; customize configuration files; and logging.
