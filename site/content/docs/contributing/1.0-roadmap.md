# Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

New year, new roadmap üéâ  

This document outlines some goals, non-goals, and future aspirations for kind
as a project.

High level goals for kind include:

- [ ] Reach [1.0] status / 
stability by the end of Q1 2019 / the Kubernetes 1.14 release cycle
- [x] Support multi-node clusters - [#117]
- [ ] Support offline / air-gapped clusters
  - [ ] pre-loaded / offline CNI - [#200]
- [ ] Support mounting host directories - [#62]
- [ ] Improve Windows support
  - [x] add Windows binaries to releases - [#155]
  - [ ] improve instructions for KUBECONFIG in particular
- [ ] Improve documentation - In Progress ...
  - [ ] expand examples of using kind
  - [ ] cover known issues, debugging, work-arounds, etc.
  - [X] create a documentation site - [#268]
- [ ] Improving logging and debuggability
  - [ ] enable audit-logging
- [ ] Support non-amd64 architectures (namely ARM) - [#166]
- [ ] Automated publishing of Kubernetes release based kind "node" images - [#197]

**Non**-Goals include:

- Supporting every possible Kubernetes configuration
  - In order to best support offline / hermetic clusters, we will likely not
  offer many options for CNI etc. out of the box. We may revisit this later.
- Being "production workload ready" - kind is meant to be used:
  - for testing Kubernetes itself
  - for testing against Kubernetes (EG in CI on Travis, Circle, etc.)
  - for "local" clusters on developer machines
  - NOT to host workloads serving user traffic etc.
- Replacing [Phippy] ü¶í -- kind isn't trying to replace all the things
and Phippy is awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è

Longer Term goals include:

- Enabling a suitable local storage provider for testing applications that need
persistent storage
- Improving "kind as a library"

Misc:

- [x] setup a regular Zoom meeting for the project [#244]
- [x] achieve certified Kubernetes conformance [#245]
