# kind's docs

Januys's docs are built with [hugo], and can be browsed live at https://kamus.soluto.io/

To browse them locally, install hugo and run `make serve` from this directory.

## Attribution
Kamus docs are based on [kind] docs. All the content was replaced, but the underline framework is the same. Thank you Kind team for building your website!
